# HeartSense
This machine learning binary classification project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients.
The model is trained on a dataset containing various medical attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol levels and more which is able to classify patients as either having heart disease or not. Different types of models such as Logistic Regression and Cat Boost has been tested for this project in order to get the best result.
The project also includes different charts in order to give more visual representation. This project can be used by healthcare professionals for identifying high risk patients and potentially saving lives.
There is also a version of the final model in models directory which is created using hyperparameter tuning in order to achieve the best results.
